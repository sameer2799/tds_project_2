# README: Analysis of Country Well-being Indicators 

## Overview
This README summarizes the analysis of a dataset containing well-being indicators across various countries. The dataset includes multiple variables, such as Life Ladder scores, GDP per capita, social support, and health metrics, recorded over several years. The primary objective of the analysis was to uncover trends and relationships between these indicators and their implications for policy-making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **Country name**: Identifies each country (object type).
- **Year**: The year of observation (integer type).
- **Life Ladder**: A subjective measure of well-being or happiness (float type).
- **Log GDP per capita**: Natural logarithm of GDP per capita (float type).
- **Social support**: Measure of support available to individuals (float type).
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average number of years an individual is expected to live in good health (float type).
- **Freedom to make life choices**: Perception of freedom in life decisions (float type).
- **Generosity**: Citizens' willingness to give (float type).
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Views on corruption within the government and businesses (float type).
- **Positive affect**: Score measuring experiences of positive emotions (float type).
- **Negative affect**: Score measuring experiences of negative emotions (float type).

## Analysis Conducted
1. **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap was generated to identify relationships between the various well-being indicators. Strong correlations were observed between:
   - Life Ladder and Log GDP per capita.
   - Life Ladder and Social support.
   - Life Ladder and Healthy life expectancy at birth.

2. **Boxplot Analysis**: A boxplot representing the distribution of Life Ladder scores across different countries was created. This visualization highlighted disparities in well-being between countries, as well as potential outliers.

3. **Trend Analysis**: A line chart illustrated the average Life Ladder scores over the years, revealing a notable decline in 2005, followed by gradual recovery and fluctuations in subsequent years.

## Insights Discovered
- **Significant Predictors of Well-being**: Higher Log GDP per capita and stronger social support are correlated with higher Life Ladder scores, indicating that economic and social factors play crucial roles in individual well-being.
- **Country Disparities**: The boxplot reveals substantial variation in Life Ladder scores among countries, suggesting that local policies and initiatives significantly influence well-being.
- **Temporal Trends**: The average well-being score experienced a dip in 2005 but showed stability and slight growth afterward, indicating resilience or recovery in the populationâ€™s perception of well-being.

## Implications of Findings
- **Policy Recommendations**: Governments should focus on enhancing social support systems and fostering economic growth to improve citizens' well-being. Programs that increase individual freedom and reduce perceived corruption can also contribute positively.
- **Focus on Disparities**: Countries exhibiting low Life Ladder scores must investigate underlying causes and implement targeted interventions to boost overall well-being.
- **Continued Monitoring**: Regular assessment of these well-being indicators is essential for understanding their evolution and informing policy over time, ensuring that interventions remain effective and relevant.

This analysis emphasizes the interplay between economic, social, and personal factors in shaping well-being and offers pathways for actionable policy improvements.
